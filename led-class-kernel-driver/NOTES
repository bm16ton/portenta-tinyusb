so need to edit

usb_avr_led_work2(struct work_struct *work2)
{
   struct my_usb *sd = container_of(work2, struct my_usb, work2);

   usb_control_msg(sd->udev,
                   usb_sndctrlpipe(sd->udev, 0),
                   value2, USB_TYPE_VENDOR | USB_DIR_OUT,
                   0, 0,
                   NULL, 0,
                   1000);
}


and one of those 0s is a brequest/index etc so need to change it to say a 1 then have firmware switch between the leds by looking at that number
