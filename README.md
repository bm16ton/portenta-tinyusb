This is a fork of tinyusb for portenta h7, current testing is limited but seems ok. Will put two versions of the a script(wrapper) for dfu-util in portenta-tools one will be manual (requires typing the /dev/ttyACM* the other will use lib serial to auto find the portenta, both should auto-reset the protenta using 1200baud request. Currently the bsp folder protenta works for builds that i have tried IE "make BOARD=protenta clean" "make BOARD=protenta all" Currently after loading firmware the protenta comes up then reboots 3 times then is rock solid even after unplugs...dunno why seems strange, I can even hot reset before the 3 reboots to stop them and all is good. I modified the dual cdc example to pull the rgb Red and Blue low on connection leaving green (boots to white)
